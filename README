2) then create the static and shared libraries of libzippp:
	make

3) you may want to run the tests:
	make tests

4) now you just have to include the src folder in your include path and
   link against libzippp.a or libzippp.so (do not forget to also link 
   against libzip libraries in lib/libzip-0.11.1/lib/.libs/).
   An example of compilation with g++ (note also the -lz at the end) :
   	g++ -I./lib/libzip-0.11.1/lib -I./src main.cpp libzippp.a lib/libzip-0.11.1/lib/.libs/libzip.a -lz
